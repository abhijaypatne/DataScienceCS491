Question 1:
I am using hardcoded dictionary for spelling corrections.
I have attached big.txt just in case the Peter Norvig solution is being accepted. I have commented code as I am not using it.

Question 2:
I am not using provided superbowl.html as it was corrupted. I am reading directly from wikipedia, so internet connection is required to run this program.
